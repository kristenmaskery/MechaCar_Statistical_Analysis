## Project Overview 

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

**1.	Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?**

    a.	As can be determined by the t-value the Vehicle Weight, spoiler_angle and AWD provide a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values. Whereas, the           variables with the least non-random amount of variance are vehicle_length and ground_clearance. 
    
**2.	Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?**

    a.	The slope of the linear model would not be considered zero, this is due to the specified p-value being less than 0.05. 
    
**3.	Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?**

    a.	The provided linear model indicates an r-squared value of 71%; R-squared values indicate the percentage difference between the independent and dependent         variables in the dataset. Therefore, we can determine that approximately 71% of the time the linear model will predict the mpg values effectively, the remaining     29% could be due to instrumental error and/or external factors.
